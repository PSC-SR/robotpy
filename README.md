robotpy
=======

This is the python libraries created by Student Robotics (SR) as well as the scipts used to control the robot and launch user code. The robotpy folder should be placed on the memory stick alongside the robot.zip in the topmost part of the folder hierachy, as it is called by the robot.zip. User code is found in robotpy/user with the first file being launched as robot.py. You can write and add files in the same region in the same way as you would on the ide - all parts of the SR libraries are available for use; although you may want to find a python syntax checker to ensure all your code is correctly typed.
